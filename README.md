# FRENZY

## üí° Inspiration
The inspiration of this project came from the diversity in the shark species which most people are curious about but at the same time unaware. This is solved very creatively by adding a automatic detection of the shark species by just using the picture. A lot of people like to do surfing and differnt water sports which is fun but at the same time they sometimes spot some water animals injured or in a unusual state. They don't have much choice there even if they want to help. Frenzy comes with a feature of contacting the helpline number whenever you spot any injured animal. The information is reached to the top faculties and the needful help is provided. This helps us go closer to a helping animals in a more efficient way.

## üíª What it does

Our web app "APP NAME" is built with features:

- Mark the places where you saw any presence of a shark.
- This marker will help other visitors or surfers to prevent going there.
- A notification will be received by Animal Rescue about the place where the shark was spotted.
- Find out different species of sharks and their characteristics.

<!-- ## ‚òÅÔ∏è Best Use of Appwrite

We are using Appwrite for building our backend. We are using **Appwrite's Database** to store the data of the markers and the users. We are also using **Appwrite's Storage** to store the images of the markers. We are using **Appwrite's Functions** to send the notification to Animal Rescue. We are using **Appwrite's OAuth** to authenticate the users. We are using **Appwrite's Console** to manage the database and the storage. We are using **Appwrite's CLI** to deploy the functions. Appwrite made it very easy for us to build our backend. We learned how robust & fast Appwrite services are as it has a free plan that was great for us student hackers.

## ü§ù Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- **GitHub Project**: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the - GitHub project management tool.
- **Using PRs and Issues**: We are doing multiple PRs and building multiple issues to keep on track of the project.

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- It was a bit difficult to train the model because of the limited dataset.
- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- As it was the first time we were using Appwrite, we had to learn it and implement it in our project.
- It was a bit difficult to implement the Appwrite Functions in our project at the beginning, but we were able to complete it.
